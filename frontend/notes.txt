-Applying Preset Styles to components
  No longer do using 'class=""' element attribute.
  Instead it is done using design Tokens (dt).
  This is how to use DTs:
    1. For your component create a typescript file, use the following convention: 'component-name.component.styles.ts'
    2. Create a class attribute/variable in your 'component-name.component.ts' (not 'component-name.component.styles.ts'), to pass in the styling.
